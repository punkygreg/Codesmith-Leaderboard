The goal of the ALPHA version of this program is to keep track of win loss records within CODESMITH family for the various social games present at the office
Three games will be the focus of the ALPHA: Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, and of course, Ping Pong (aka Table Tennis). 
This will help promote healthy competition and entice more students to play to see how they fare against their cohort mates.

Note: Although ping pong is the only functional leaderboard at the moment, We are working hard to get Mario Kart and Super Smash Leaderboards running.
